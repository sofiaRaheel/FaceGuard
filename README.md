# FaceGuard â€“ Tamper-Proof Facial Attendance System with Blockchain Logging

### Secure, AI-powered, Immutable Records

---

## Project Overview

**FaceGuard** is a conceptual prototype that merges **face recognition** with **blockchain logging** to build a tamper-proof attendance system. Designed for educational or office environments, the system securely detects and logs attendance with cryptographic verification.

##  Objectives

- Detect and recognize faces from images
- Record attendance with secure timestamps
- Generate hashed identity logs
- Store attendance immutably on the blockchain
- Display attendance confirmation via a simple web UI

## Key Concepts Explored

- Face detection and encoding
- Face comparison and recognition
- Hashing (SHA256) for identity verification
- Smart contracts for secure record storage
- UI interaction via Streamlit



## How It Works

1. **Face Registration**  
   Upload a face image and enter a name. The face is encoded and saved locally with the name.

2. **Take Attendance**  
   Upload an image. The system compares detected faces to known faces. If matched, attendance is recorded.

3. **Blockchain Logging**  
   Attendance data (name + timestamp) is hashed using SHA256 and logged immutably to the blockchain.

4. **View Records**  
   See all attendance records with validation status (i.e., hash verification).
